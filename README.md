This year's attempt at a party hack for Birdie 24 gamedev compo

Name TBD.

Things that are for pussies:
 * Freeing your malloced structs
 * Thread safety
 * Source code comments

Because redneck farmers aint no damn pussies, this code contains nonthing of the above.
Instead, this code contains one or several of these other very manly, rednecky things:
 * goto:s
 * function pointers
 * copy-paste
